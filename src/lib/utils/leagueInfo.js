  <p>Required Homies Fantasy Football League was established in 2015 by a group of 12 men who believe fantasy football is the ultimate form of showing intellectual prowess. The winners of this league are an elite group of men who have withstood the trials and tribulations that are a part of achieving greatness.</p>
  <p>In 2019, the league migrated to Sleeper app from ESPN. While this transition was an imporatant move for the league, some of the historical information is kept in offline arcives and is not represented on this webiste. Additionally, this webisite is under construction and some of the information within, such as the league constitution, is not accurate at this time.</p>
  <p>We hope you enjoy this website and use it to appreciate the achievements (or lacking there of) of these men who pour their heart and soul into the league to continue its reputation of greatness.</p>
